# password-generator

## Description
A site that generates a password based on user specification. The user is able to choose the length of their password, given it is within the valid range, and the type of characters it is composed of i.e. lower/uppercase alphabet, numbers or special characters. This can help provide users with a stronger password compared to making one up on their own of dictionary words and numbers. If a user chooses the minimum of an 8 length password and selects all 4 criteria for the password to be comprised of, it would already produce a key space (or outcome) of `(26 * 2 + 10 + 32)^8 = 6,095,689,385,410,816`. This is a lot more effective than creating a password with common words, which reduces the number of combinations passwords could be, that someone with malicious intent can perform a dictionary attack on and take much less time to solve. It is no trouble on the user's end other than clicking the 'generate password' button and choosing their desired length and password criteria.
